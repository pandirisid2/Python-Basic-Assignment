1.Function is a set of code which is specified to perform some task so that it helps to reuse this part of code again and again just by calling function using function name.
2.Only when its called the code in function runs.
3.def function_name:
    pass 
  this will create a function
4.function is defined only once whereas the function-call we can reuse many times when ever we need to call in the code.
5.A global scope is defining the variables above functions at the start of the code where as the local scope is for the variables defined inside a loop or inside a function. Global scope variables are accessible to all functions and local variables are only accessible to that functions.
6.when return statement is executed, all the local variables of that function are erased from memory.
7.return is used to return some kind of output from the function. Yes it is possible to return a value in expression.
8.None is the default return when there is no return statement in fn.
9.use 'global' keyword to refer to global varibale 
10.class 'NoneType'
11.if its a package, import will call the package and in the following code lines we can use methods of that package.
12.>>import spam
    >>spam.bacon()
    
13.Use try:,except:, else: and finally: blocks to handle all exceptions/code crashes because of errors.
14.try is used to put all code lines where there is a possibility of exception and except block is used to catch all the raised exceptions and handle them in except block.
