1. The two values of boolean data type are True and False. they are written as True and False
2. The three types of boolean operator are and, or, not
3. And : T and T = T, T and F = F, F and T = F, F and F = F
    OR : T or T = T, T or F = T, F or T = T, F or F = F
    NOT: not T = F, not F = T

4.(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) is False
    not (5 > 4) is False
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) is True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) is False
    (True and True) and (True == False) is False
    (not False) or (not True) is True
    
5.Comparison operators : <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
6.Difference between the equal to== and assignment= is assignment is used to assign the values to operand and equal to is used to compare two operands. Ex: >>a=5 >>b=6 >>a==b

7.first block: if, second block:if and third block:else
8.if spam==1:
      print("Hello")
  elif spam==2:
      print("Howdy")
  else:
      print("Greetings!")
      
9.ctrl+c or ctrl+z is used to stop infinite loop

10.break is used to get out of the loop and continue is used to skip this iteration and go for next iteration

11.In a for loop all these range(10) ,range(0,10), range(0,10,1) perform same operations starts from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Just the difference is we specified the increment of iteration=1

12.for i in range(1,11):
       print(i)
   i=1
   while(i<11):
       print(i)
       i++
13.module spam
